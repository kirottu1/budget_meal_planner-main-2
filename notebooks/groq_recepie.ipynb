Food poisoning not only sends \\n128,000 Americans to the hospital each year, it can also have long -term health effects. \\nThe keys to basic food safety are cooking it to the right temperature and handling it properly. Follow these guidelines to keep you, your family, and your guests safe.\\nFor more information on these and other food safety guidelines, please visit www.foodsafety.gov.\\nPractice Good Hygiene\\nUse hot water and regular soap to wash your hands. Scrub the backs \\nof your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails for at least \\n20 seconds. Need a timer? Try humming the “Happy Birthday ” song \\nfrom beginning to end twice. Rinse hands, then dry with a clean towel.\\nWash your hands often, especially during these key times when germs \\ncan spread:\\n•Before, during, and after preparing food\\n•Before serving food or eating\\n•After handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, or their juices\\n•After using the toilet, touching garbage, touching an animal or picking something up off the floor\\n•After changing a diaper or taking care of someone who is sick\\n•After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing\\nCook to Safe Temperatures\\nCook all food to the minimum safe internal temperatures on the chart above. Use a food thermometer to be sure \\nyour food is safe. When you think your food is done, place the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food, \\nmaking sure not to touch bone, fat, or gristle.Safe Internal Food Temperatures\\nPoultry \\nWhole or Pieces 165°F\\nGround 165°F\\nBeef, Pork, and Lamb \\nSteaks/Roasts/Chops 145°FGround 160°F\\nPre-Cooked Ham 140°F\\nSeafood Fish Fillet/Whole Fish 145°FShrimp/Lobster/Crab Cook until \\nflesh is pearly \\nLeftovers and Casseroles 165°F\\nEgg Dishes 160°F \\nCooking Safely3\\nTable of Contents\\nSeparate Hazardous Foods\\nUse one cutting board for hazardous foods (e.g. raw meat, poultry, \\nseafood, eggs) and another for non -hazardous foods (e.g. fresh \\nproduce, cooked foods, foods that won ’t be cooked). \\nUse separate plates and utensils for cooked and raw foods. Use hot, \\nsoapy water to wash all plates, utensils, and cutting boards that \\ntouched hazardous foods before using them again.\\nRefrigerate and Freeze Properly\\nYour refrigerator should be set to 40°F or below and your freezer to \\n0°F or below. Use a refrigerator and/or freezer thermometer to be \\nsure. Place raw meat, poultry, and seafood on plates, in containers, or \\nin sealed plastic bags. Freeze them if you ’re not planning to use them \\nwithin a few days. Freezing does not kill harmful germs, but it does keep food safe until you can cook it.\\nAvoid the Danger Zone\\nBacteria that cause food poisoning grow quickest between 41°F and \\n135°F, also known as the danger zone. Never leave perishable foods \\nat room temperature for more than two hours. If the food is exposed \\nto temperatures above 90°F, refrigerate it within one hour.\\nIf you’re not serving food right after cooking, keep it out of the \\ntemperature danger zone by using a heat source like a chafing dish, \\nwarming tray, or slow cooker. Cold foods can be kept on ice or in a \\ncooler for longer serving times.\\nNever thaw or marinate foods at room temperature. The safest way \\nto thaw or marinate is in the refrigerator. Leftovers should be placed \\nin small shallow containers and refrigerated promptly to allow for \\nquick cooling. \\nWash Produce\\nCut away any damaged or bruised areas on fruits and vegetables, then rinse under warm running water. Scrub \\nfirm produce like melons, potatoes, or cucumbers with a clean produce brush. Air dry or pat dry with a paper towel or clean cloth towel. Don ’t rinse raw meat, poultry, seafood, or shell eggs.\\nWhen In Doubt, Throw It Out\\nThe germs that make you sick are not always the same ones that cause food to go bad. Don ’t use smell, taste, and \\nappearance as your only guides. Use the storage times on the table above to guide you. If you ’re still not sure \\nwhether a food item is safe, it ’s better to be safe than sorry and throw it away.
